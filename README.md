# MemDB
A web application to help you choose the right kit of RAM for your system.

## Future Plans
Integrate this project with AngularJS
https://angularjs.org/

Build the beginnings of a system in the application to make sure you don't waste money on a RAM kit your CPU or Motherboard don't even support.

# API
I'm using a Node.js API to retrieve parts from PCPartPicker
