# MemDB
A web application to help you choose the right kit of RAM for your system.

## Future Plans
Add advanced properties to RAM like more in-depth timings, DRAM manufacturer, and Die type.
Example: 
DRAM Manufacturer : Samsung 
Die Type: (B-Die)
Advanced Timings: 
["CL": "16", "RCD": "18", "RP": "18", "RAS": "38", "RC": "56", "CR": "2T", "RFC": "560", "RFC2": "416", "RFC4": "256", "RRDL": "8", "RRDS": "6", "FAW": "39"]

## Use
Build the beginnings of a system in the application to make sure you don't waste money on a RAM kit your CPU or Motherboard don't even support.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine

Install necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
npm install -g http-server

```

Start the server:

```
http-server
```

## API
I'm now using a modified version of a Node.js API to retrieve parts from PCPartPicker
by Rishi Masand located at https://github.com/darthbatman

My modified version lives at https://github.com/Adobe-Android/MemDB-server
(Only added necessary node bits and one extra socket type. This was very easy thanks to the code structure I inherited. Future socket additions would also be extremely easy to implement.) Please see this project page as well as both components are necessary for this application to work.
