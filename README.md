# MemDB
A web application to help you choose the right kit of RAM for your system.

## Future Plans
Integrate this project with AngularJS
https://angularjs.org/

Build the beginnings of a system in the application to make sure you don't waste money on a RAM kit your CPU or Motherboard don't even support.

# API
I'm now using a modified version of a Node.js API to retrieve parts from PCPartPicker
by Rishi Masand located at https://github.com/darthbatman

My modified version lives at https://github.com/Adobe-Android/MemDB-server
(Only added necessary node bits and one extra socket type. This was very easy thanks to the code structure I inherited. Future socket additions would also be extremely easy to implement.)
